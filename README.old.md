- Yatzy Application

# Application description

- Yatzy is a chance-and-strategy dice rolling game. A game is played over 13 rounds. Each round, the player rolls 5 six-sided dice. A player may click on any number of dice to "freeze" or "unfreeze" them(frozen dice are displayed in a different color). A player may re-roll the unfrozen dice up to 2 times. Each round, a player assigns his dice to any unclaimed scoring categry. Each category scores differently. After 13 rounds, the game is over, and the player's score is the total of each scoring category.
